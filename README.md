# FlightDelayProject
This project applies modern Big Data techniques on a Kaggle flight dataset. Using Pandas, PySpark, and Plotly, data was cleaned, visualized, and integrated into a Power BI dashboard. A 70/30 ML model predicts flight delays, with a report summarizing insights, predictions, and KPIs.
